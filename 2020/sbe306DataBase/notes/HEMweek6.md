## Exercises
Regard the following Relational model

![](../images/pract1.png)

### Cross Product and JOIN Query
**Q1** Retrieve employees names who are working in the Research department.

* cross product:
```
SELECT FNAME,LNAME
from employee,department
where DNO = DNUMBER and DNAME = 'Research'
```
* JOIN Query:
```
SELECT FNAME,LNAME FROM 
employee JOIN department ON DNO = DNUMBER 
Where DNAME = 'Research'
```

**Q2** Retrieve project names where the last name of the department manager is Wong

* cross product:
```
SELECT PNAME
from employee,department,project
where DNUM = DNUMBER and MGRSSN = SSN and LNAME = "Wong"
```

* JOIN Query:
```
SELECT PNAME from 
employee JOIN department ON MGRSSN = SSN
JOIN project ON DNUM = DNUMBER 
WHERE LNAME = "Wong"
```

**Q3** Retrieve managers names having projects in 'Stafford'

* cross product:
```
SELECT FNAME,LNAME
from employee,department,project
where DNUM = DNUMBER and MGRSSN = SSN and Plocation = "Stanfford"
```

* JOIN Query
```
SELECT FNAME,LNAME from 
employee JOIN department ON MGRSSN = SSN 
JOIN project ON DNUM = DNUMBER 
WHERE Plocation = "Stanfford"
```
### Nested queries

**Q1** Retrieve project names where the department manager last name is Wong or project names where employee smith is working in.

* Nested Query
```
SELECT PNAME
from project
where PNUMBER in
(SELECT PNUMBER from employee
JOIN department on MGRSSN = SSN
JOIN project on DNUM = DNUMBER
where LNAME = "Wong" )
or PNUMBER in (SELECT PNUMBER from employee
JOIN works_on on ESSN = SSN
JOIN project on PNO = PNUMBER
where LNAME = "Smith" )
```

* Union Clause
```
SELECT Pname from
project JOIN JOIN department on DNUM = DNUMBER
JOIN employee ON MGRSSN = SSN
WHERE Lname= "Wong"
UNION
SELECT Pname from
project JOIN works_on on Pnumber = Pno
JOIN employee on SSN = ESSN
WHERE Lname= "Smith"
```

**Try to solve the following**

1. Retrieve the names of all employees in ‘Research’ department who work
more than 10 hours per week on the ProductX project.


2. List the names of all employees who have a dependent with the same first
name as themselves.


3. For each project, list the project name and the total hours per week (by all
employees) spent on that project.

4. Retrieve the names of all employees who do not work on any project.
