## Variables on Stack Memory

--
The following variables are allocated on the stack

```c++
char x = 's';

float pi = 3.1415;

int k = 0;

int j = k;

double e {2.71828};
```

--
- Automatically deleted after going out of their scope.
--
- Very simple.

## Address of a Variable in the Memory

* Variables exist in memory. 
* A variable in memory has an address.

---
class: left, top

```c++
// Declare integer x and initialize it with 13.
int x = 13;

// Declare integer y and initialize it with 1.
int y = 1;

// Declare integer z and initialize it with 5.
int z = 5;
```

Their physical presence in memory looks like this:

## Address of a variable in C++

--
But how to get (retrieve) the address of a variable in C++?

--
* By using `&` (ampersand operator).

--
```c++
int x = 5;

std::cout << &x << "\n"; 
// Prints: the location of x in memory
```

---
class: left, top
## Pointers 

--
We store the address of a variable in a special type called **pointer**.

- **Pointer** is a primitive data type.
- **Pointer** type occupies **8 bytes** (64-bit machines).
- **Pointer** is declared using the syntax: `int *` for pointer to integer, `double *` for pointer to doubles, ...etc.

--
```c++
int x = 13;
int y = 1;
int z = 5;
// Declare 'pointer to integer' px and 
// initialize with address of x.
int *px = &x; 

// Declare 'pointer to integer' py and 
// initialize with address of y.
int *py = &y;

// Declare 'pointer to integer' pz and 
// initialize with address of z.
int *pz = &z;
```

## Primitive Data Types in C++ (Revisited)

#### Primitive Data Types (PDT) in C++

* `bool`: holds logical value, occupies **1 byte** of memory.
* `char`: a character, occupies **1 byte** of memory.
* `int`: an integer, occupies **4 bytes** of memory.
* `float`: a real-number-like, occupies **4 bytes** of memory.
* `double`: like float, but higher precision, occupies **8 bytes** of memory.
--
* pointer: holds the location of a variable in memory, occupies **8 bytes** of memory.

## Why using Address?

--
### Flexibility

Addresses gives a great flexibility to control variables. For example, you can modify a variable value if you have its address.

```c++
    int x = 9;

    std::cout << x << std::endl; // prints: 9

    int *px = &x ;

    // Derefrencing px to access x.
    *px = 13;

    std::cout << x << std::endl; // prints 13
```

---
class: left, top
### Passing arguments by pointer

--
You can pass a **pointer to variable** as argument to a function.

--
```c++
void max( double a , double b , double *presults )
{
    // Dereference the presults to access the underlying variable.
    if( a > b ) *presults = a;
    else *presults = b;
}

int main()
{
    double results = 0; double x = 0; double y = 0;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    max( x , y , &results ); // Now results has new value.
    std::cout << results << "\n";
}
```

---
class: left, top
### Passing arguments by pointer


You can pass a **pointer to variable** as argument to a function.


```c++
void max( double a , double b , double *presults )
{
    // Dereference the presults to access the underlying variable.
    if( a > b ) *presults = a;
    else *presults = b;
}

int main()
{
*   double results = 0, x = 0, y = 0;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    max( x , y , &results ); // Now results has new value.
    std::cout << results << "\n";
}
```

--
* this style acceptable in C language. 
* not preferred in C++, and always prefer to return the results.

### Cont'd

Which is better?



This?

```c++
void max( double a , double b , double *presults )
{
    if( a > b ) *presults = a;
    else *presults = b;
}

int main()
{
    double results = 0, x = 0; y = 0;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    max( x , y , &results ); 
    std::cout << results << "\n";
}
```
---
class: top, left
### Cont'd

Which is better?



Or this?

```c++
double max( double a , double b )
{
    if( a > b) return a;
    else return b;
}

int main()
{
    double x = 0; y = 0;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    double results = max( x , y );
    std::cout << results << "\n";
}
```

## Stack Memory vs. Heap Memory

| Stack Memory | Heap Memory |
|---|---|
| <p class="text-danger">Limited capacity</p> | <p class="text-success">Large capacity for scalable structures</p>  |
| <p class="text-success">Automatic memory management</p> | <p class="text-danger">Manual memory management</p> |

---
class: left, top
## Variables on Heap Memory

Variables can also be created on heap.

```c++
// Allocate integer with initializing to zero 
// on heap memory, and save the address in px.
int *px = new int{0};

// Allocate integer with initializing to 4 
// on heap memory, and save the address in py.
int *py = new int(4); 


int *pz = new int(8);
```

Physically, they would look like this: 

.center[<img src="/gallery/heapaddress.png" style="width:30%;">]

---
class: left, top
## Memory Management

--
* Variables created on heap memory (using `new` operator), should be deleted manually when they are no longer used. 
* Otherwise, you will allocate a lot of space that will become unusable.


--
```c++
int *px = new int{0};

int *py = new int(4);

int *pz = new int(8);
```

--
* After making some prcessing on `px`, `py`, and `pz`

```c++
delete px;
delete py;
delete pz;
```

---
### Important rule for memory management

--
* To avoid memory leaks, make sure that allocations/deallocations are balanced in the en.
--
* \# `new` = \# `delete`.

---

## Reference types

--
* Very important type in C++, 
--
* Using it in the right way makes your program very efficient. 
--
* **References** are alternative for pointers to enhance the readability of your code.
--
* When you make a reference to a variable, you actually making an alias to that variable.
--
* In other words, you are making another name for the same variable.

---

## Primitive Data Types in C++ (Revisited 2)

#### Primitive Data Types (PDT) in C++

* `bool`: holds logical value, occupies **1 byte** of memory.
* `char`: a character, occupies **1 byte** of memory.
* `int`: an integer, occupies **4 bytes** of memory.
* `float`: a real-number-like, occupies **4 bytes** of memory.
* `double`: like float, but higher precision, occupies **8 bytes** of memory.
--
* **pointer**: holds the location of a variable in memory, occupies **8 bytes** of memory.
--
* **reference**: an alias to an existing variable, occupies **8 bytes** of memory.

---
class: left, top
## References in C++

--
```c++
// Declaration of integer x and initializing with zero.
int x = 0;

// Declaration of reference y and to be reference for x.
int &y = x;

// Now x and y, are the same variable, but with different name.

// Chaning y value, will also affect x, and vice versa.
y = 10;

std::cout << x << "\n"; // prints: 10
```

---
class: left, top
### Cont'd

Recall the example of passing pointer as argument:

```c++
void max( double a , double b , double *presults )
{
    if( a > b ) *presults = a;
    else *presults = b;
}

int main()
{
    double results = 0, x = 0, y = 0;
    std::cin >> x >> y;
    max( x , y , &results );
    std::cout << results << "\n";
}
```

---
class: left, top
This can be written in more elegant way using references:

```c++
void max( double a , double b , double &results )
{
    // No need for dereference as we did in pointers, like it is a real variable!
    if( a > b ) results = a;
    else results = b;
}

int main()
{
    double results = 0;

    // No need to pass the address explicitly.
    max( 13 , 5 , results );

    std::cout << results << "\n";
}
```

---
class: left, top
## Rule: Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)

More about [{KISS}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle.

**But again, it is very preferred to use the simplest form when possible**!

```c++
double max( double a , double b )
{
    return (a > b)? a : b;
}

int main()
{
    double results = max( 13 , 5 );
}
```

We used pointer and references in previous examples just for explanations!
