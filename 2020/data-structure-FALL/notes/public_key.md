## Generate private key on your machine

Open your terminal and run the `ssh-keygen` app, then press enter for any dialog:

```
$ ssh-keygen
> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Press enter]
```

Now you generated a private key.

## Copy your public key that was generated alongside the private key

To copy your public key contents, print the file on the terminal using the following command `more ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, then you should see a long generated text like so:

```
$ more ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCf4n+BJddGKbJ3h2VK07yCFZ+xf1Nofz0ydWLi2uHE

```

Using your mouse, select all the text the is shown after the command `more ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

### Add your new key information

![ssh4](/gallery/add_ssh4.png)


## Use SSH links instead of HTTPS

### Cloning a new repository

If you are going to clone a new repository, just make sure to use the link associated with **SSH**, not ~~HTTPS~~.

![clone](/gallery/clone_ssh.png)

Make sure the link starts with `git@` instead of `https://`.

### If your repository already cloned using HTTPS

If you have already cloned a repository using `HTTPS` link, retrieve the **SSH** link as shown above, then issue the following command in a terminal **placed in your repository**:

```
git remote set-url origin [ssh link]
```

Replace `[ssh link]` with the actual **SSH** link your retrieved.
